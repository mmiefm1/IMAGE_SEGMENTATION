# Image Segmentation using Mask R-CNN and U-Net
Image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves partitioning an image into multiple segments or regions, each of which corresponds to different objects or parts ofobjects. The primary goal of image segmentation is to simplify the representation of an image and make it more meaningful and easier to analyze.
## Description
This project demonstrates image segmentation using Mask R-CNN and U-Net. The models are applied to segment objects in various images, highlighting their applications in fields such as medical imaging and autonomous driving.

## Types of Image Segmentation
### Semantic Segmentation 
- **Definition**: Assigns a label to each pixel in the image, classifying each pixel into a predefined category. All pixels belonging to the same class are given the same label.
- **Applications**: 
  - **Autonomous Driving**: Identifying different elements such as roads, vehicles, pedestrians, and traffic signs.
  - **Medical Imaging**: Segmenting different anatomical structures like organs, tissues, and tumors.
  - **Satellite Imagery**: Classifying land cover types like forests, water bodies, and urban areas.
- **Example**: Segmenting an image of a street scene into classes such as road, cars, pedestrians, and buildings.
